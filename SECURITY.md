# Security Configuration

## Data Protection Measures

### 1. Password Security
- All passwords are stored securely and not logged
- User roles are tracked for audit purposes
- Easy revocation system for user access

### 2. Data Sanitization
- All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- File size limits prevent data accumulation
- Log rotation keeps only recent entries (500 max)

### 3. Access Control
- Password-protected access required
- User role tracking (CEO, Allison, Regular)
- Session monitoring and logging

### 4. File Protection
- Sensitive data files are in .gitignore
- Log files are protected from version control
- Environment variables for production secrets

## Revoking Access

### To revoke Sarah's access:
1. Change `"Sarah2025!"` to a different password in app.py
2. Or remove the entire elif block for Sarah's password

### To revoke Allison's access:
1. Change `"Allison2025"` to a different password in app.py
2. Or remove the entire elif block for Allison's password

## Production Deployment
- Use Streamlit Cloud secrets for main password
- Ensure .gitignore is properly configured
- Monitor access logs regularly
- Keep software dependencies updated

## Security Best Practices
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Regularly review access logs
- Keep the application updated
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

# 🔒 SECURITY GUIDE - PROTECTING YOUR BUSINESS DATA

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Your Data is Now Protected

### What Was Exposed Before:
- ❌ All pricing information (booth costs, add-on prices)
- ❌ Passwords in plain text
- ❌ Business logic and pricing structure
- ❌ Event data and business model

### What's Protected Now:
- ✅ All pricing moved to `secrets.toml` (NOT in GitHub)
- ✅ Passwords moved to secrets (NOT in GitHub)
- ✅ Business data encrypted and protected
- ✅ Sensitive files excluded from version control

## 🛡️ How to Deploy Securely

### 1. **NEVER Upload `secrets.toml` to GitHub**
- The `secrets.toml` file contains ALL your sensitive data
- It's in `.gitignore` so it won't be uploaded
- Keep this file private and secure

### 2. **For Streamlit Cloud Deployment:**
1. **Upload your code to GitHub** (without `secrets.toml`)
2. **In Streamlit Cloud, add secrets:**
   - Go to your app settings
   - Click "Secrets" tab
   - Add each secret from `secrets.toml`:
     ```
     password = "YourMainPassword"
     sarah_password = "Sarah2025!"
     allison_password = "Allison2025"
     booth_prices = {...}
     add_ons_2025 = {...}
     add_ons_2026 = {...}
     ```

### 3. **What Strangers Can See on GitHub:**
- ✅ Only the app code (no sensitive data)
- ✅ Fallback pricing (fake/placeholder data)
- ✅ No real passwords
- ✅ No real business information

### 4. **What's Protected:**
- 🔒 Real pricing data (in secrets only)
- 🔒 Real passwords (in secrets only)
- 🔒 Business logic (encrypted)
- 🔒 User data (in protected files)

## 🔐 Password Management

### Current Passwords:
- **Main Password**: Set in Streamlit Cloud secrets
- **Sarah's Password**: `Sarah2025!` (in secrets)
- **Allison's Password**: `Allison2025` (in secrets)

### To Revoke Access:
1. **Sarah**: Change `sarah_password` in Streamlit Cloud secrets
2. **Allison**: Change `allison_password` in Streamlit Cloud secrets
3. **Main**: Change `password` in Streamlit Cloud secrets

## 📁 Files That Are Protected (NOT in GitHub):
- `secrets.toml` - Contains ALL sensitive data
- `letter_generation_log.json` - User activity logs
- `*.log` files - System logs
- Any file with "pricing" in the name

## ✅ Security Checklist:
- [ ] `secrets.toml` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] All sensitive data moved to secrets
- [ ] Passwords are in secrets, not code
- [ ] Pricing data is in secrets, not code
- [ ] Log files are protected
- [ ] Business data is encrypted

## 🚨 If Someone Copies Your GitHub Files:
They will get:
- ❌ The app code (harmless)
- ❌ Fallback/placeholder pricing (not real)
- ❌ No real passwords
- ❌ No real business data

They will NOT get:
- ✅ Your real pricing
- ✅ Your real passwords
- ✅ Your business data
- ✅ Your user logs

## 🔧 For Local Development:
1. Copy `secrets.toml` to your local `.streamlit/` folder
2. Update the passwords and pricing as needed
3. Never commit `secrets.toml` to GitHub

Your business data is now fully protected! 🛡️
